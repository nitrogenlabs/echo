## Assembly Instructions

For step-by-step visual instructions on assembling your Raspberry Pi 5, watch this [assembly video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyHVcwiXlbg).

**Important Note:** In the video, when you reach the step for installing an SSD memory card, **instead install the BrainChip Akida M.2 Card (B+M Key)** that you purchased. The BrainChip card uses the same M.2 slot and follows the same installation process, but provides neuromorphic AI acceleration instead of storage expansion.

The BrainChip M.2 Card (B+M Key) is specifically designed for Raspberry Pi 5 and enables event-based neural network processing. For more details about the card's specifications and capabilities, see the [BrainChip product page](https://shop.brainchipinc.com/products/m-2-card-m-key).
